                <h2>Adventure!</h2>
                <p>
                    You got pretty bored sitting on the elemental ecology lectures.
                    So bored that you in fact decided to go to suicidal adventure into the dungeon (well... "dungeon" is a very strong word). <br/>
                    Actually, to be honest, not only because of the boredom, but this is what you said to everyone anyway.
                </p>

                <h2>Mechanics</h2>
                <p>
                    There are 6 types of elements:
                    <fire>fire</fire>,
                    <cold>cold</cold>,
                    <water>water</water>,
                    <lightning>lightning</lightning>,
                    <dark>dark</dark>, and
                    <light>light</light>.<br>
                    The more elements there are in the ecosystem, the more monsters are spawned in new rooms and the more degraded crafted weapon gets.<br/>
                    <br>
                    To craft stuff you need required items and required elements to be put into cauldron.
                    You put elements into cauldron by putting items into it - items will be destroyed and cauldron will receive elements contained in destroyed items.
                    When you leave the room all unused elements in cauldron are released into the ecosystem.<br/>
                    <br>
                    When you leave the room:<br/>
                    - all monsters healed to full and returned to their starting positions<br/>
                    - all the items destroyed and their elements added to ecosystem<br/>
                </p>

                <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
                <p>
                    Use boars and golems to easily murder other monsters in the room.<br/>
                    Don't forget to throw rocks into your enemies. <br/>
                    <light>Light</light> is a good element to throw into ecosystem - treants easy to kill and have good drop. <br/>
                    Hell is a good place to farm <fire>fire</fire> element for crafts. <br/>
                    <dark>Dark</dark> affects spawn rate 3 times stronger than other elements. <br/>
                    Check resistances - correctly crafted hammer can one-shot imps...
